## Competition 1: Text Feature Engineering
In this competition, you are provided with a supervised dataset X consisting of the raw content of news articles 
and the binary popularity (where 1 means "popular" and -1 not, calculated based on the number of shares in online social networking services) of these articles as labels. 
Your goal is to learn a function f from X that is able to predict the popularity of an unseen news article.\

## DataLab Cup 2: CNN for Object Detection
In this competition, you have to train a model that recognizes objects in an image. Your goal is to output bounding boxes for objects.\

## Datalab Cup3: Reverse Image Caption
In this work, we are interested in translating text in the form of single-sentence human-written descriptions directly into image pixels. For example, "this flower has petals that are yellow and has a ruffled stamen" and "this pink and yellow flower has a beautiful yellow center with many stamens". You have to develop a novel deep architecture and GAN formulation to effectively translate visual concepts from characters to pixels.\

## Datalab Cup4: Unlearnable Datasets
In this work, we try to crack the unlearnable dataset which proposed by Neural Tangent Generalization Attacks (NTGA) ICML'21
Authors of NTGA propose the generalization attack, a new direction for poisoning attacks, where an attacker aims to modify training data in order to spoil the training process such that a trained network lacks generalizability. They devise Neural Tangent Generalization Attack (NTGA), a first efficient work enabling clean-label, black-box generalization attacks against Deep Neural Networks.\
